Author Notes:

- for now just manually add destination names
- to publish on github pages [link](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)
- if the link doesnt show up on pages section, trigger some action on repo like edit and commit an md file

Fututre Scope:
- moving destination cards to reorder the trip
- adding google maps API to search and add location on maps board.
